# Selenium_WebDriver

Documents and tests developed through the Selenium WebDriver: Automation with Python.

Here you'll find some tests developed by me including:

- Avaluability of determinated product on Stanley's website
- Guinness beer discount on a supermarket website (But I just realised that the local market doesn't update the discount on online orders. Anyway, still a good try)
- Automated Sushi ordering from one of my favourite Japanese Restaurants in town

More to come.
