# Selenium_WebDriver

Documents and tests developed through the Selenium WebDriver: Automation with Python.

Here you'll find some tests developed by me including:

- evaluability of determinated product on Stanley's website
- Guinness beer discount on a supermarket website (I just realised that the market doesn't update the discount on online orders)
- Sushi ordering from one of my favourite Japanese Restaurants in town

More to come.
